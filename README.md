### Battle Royale Style Application

This Python program is a Battle Royale style application that simulates battles between phrases or items. It utilizes a list of various weapons and methods to generate realistic battle outcomes between fighters. The battles are randomized, and the last fighter standing is declared the winner.

#### Features:
- **Battle Outcome Generation:** The program randomly selects a weapon or method from a predefined list to determine how one fighter defeats another.
- **Battle Royale Functionality:** The application simulates multiple rounds of battles until only one fighter remains, who is then declared the winner.
- **User Interaction:** Users can input phrases or items, with each phrase/item representing a fighter in the battle.
- **Dark Mode Theme:** The application interface is designed with a dark mode theme for a visually appealing experience.

#### How to Use:
1. Input phrases/items representing the fighters, with each phrase/item on a separate line.
2. Click "Start Battle" to initiate the Battle Royale simulation.
3. The program will display the battle outcomes and declare the final winner.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Python:** Programming language used to develop the application.
- **Tkinter:** Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for creating the application's user interface.
- **Random Module:** Used for generating random outcomes in battles.

#### Future Improvements:
- Implement more advanced battle strategies for fighters.
- Add options for customization and interaction during battles.
- Include graphical representations of battles for a more immersive experience.
